# -----
# Recurrent Neural Networks (also known as RNNs) are a sequence-learning tool for neural networks. This type of neural network has only one layer’s worth of hidden inputs, which is re-used for each input from the sequence, along with a “memory” that’s passed ahead to the next input’s calculations. These are calculated using matrix multiplication where the matrix indices are trained weights, just like they are in a fully-connected layer. 
# 
# The same calculations are repeated for each input in the sequence, meaning that a single “layer” of a recurrent neural network can be unrolled into many layers. In fact, there will be as many layers as there are inputs in the sequence. This allows the network to process a very complex sentence. TensorFlow includes its own implementation of a vanilla RNN cell, BasicRNNCell, which can be added to your TensorFlow graph as follows:

# In[9]:


rnn_size = 64
rnn = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicRNNCell(rnn_size)


# ----
# 
# # Defining the constants for our network
# 
# Since we aren’t going to use a vanilla RNN layer in our network, let's clear out the graph and add an LSTM layer, which TensorFlow also includes by default. Since this is going to be the first part of our actual network, let's also define all the constants we'll need for the network, which we'll talk about as they come up:

# We'll also reset the graph to not include the RNN cell we added earlier, since we won't be using that for this network:

# With both those out of the way, we can define our LSTM using TensorFlow as follows:

# In[13]:


lstm = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(lstm_size)


# The loss of certain pieces of crucial memory means that complicated relationships required for first order logic have a harder time forming with dropout, and so for our LSTM layer we’ll skip using dropout on internal gates, instead using it on everything else. Thankfully, this is the default implementation of Tensorflow’s DropoutWrapper for recurrent layers:
# 

# In[14]:


lstm_drop =  tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(lstm, input_p, output_p)


# ----
# 
# With all the explanations out of the way, we can finish up our model. The first step is tokenizing and using our GloVe dictionary to turn the two input sentences into a single sequence of vectors. Since we can’t effectively use dropout on information that gets passed within an LSTM, we’ll use dropout on features from words, and on final output instead -- effectively using dropout on the first and last layers from the unrolled LSTM network portions. 
# 
# The final output from the LSTMs will be passed into a set of fully connected layers, and then from that we’ll get a single real-valued score that indicates how strong each of the kinds of entailment are, which we use to select our final result and our confidence in that result.
